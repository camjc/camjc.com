I designed and coded the front-end of this shift swapping and sharing webapp. I also made sign-up and product pages for the Shiftr apps. These all use custom semantic HTML5 and are styled using [LESS] with [Twitter Bootstrap], compiling to CSS3. I wrote parts of the [jQuery] and PHP, including use of the [Foursquare] and [Google Maps] APIs to select business locations to create an easier signup experience.
