<!-- Working with Adslot's designers I implemented their redesign of Adslot.com.
I wrote templates for [WordPress] and used [Advanced Custom Fields] to enable fully customised and easily editable layouts. I separated existing CSS into [SCSS] modules, removed un&shy;used styles and added in my own stylesheets, building on [Twitter Bootstrap].

I provided input for some design decisions. One example is the behaviour of the video reveal on the homepage. After creating templates for layouts designed in-house I was given the autonomy to extrapolate from the established design language into templates for the [corporate] and [legacy pages] and elements like drop-down menus and the footer.
