At [Adslot] we need to draw a lot of line and column graphs per page.
This called for a performant solution, preferably without adding to the page load weight.
After researching available graphing solutions I realised that
we could use [AngularJS] (which was already loaded) to replace a lot of the manipulation
that these large graphing libraries provided.
Making our own graphing library also gave us full control over the look and interaction of the graph elements .

I made a prototype of a simple line graph and performance tested 150 on a page with constantly randomizing data.
It stood up over all browsers, even IE9 (our lowest target).
This directive is [open source].

It made its debut at [Adslot] in the Q1 2014-15 launch of the new Campaign Management workflow across Adslot Media, Publisher and Partner.

In May 2015 I created a [React version of Slicey] in a weekend. I did this to learn [React] using a realâ€“world component.
