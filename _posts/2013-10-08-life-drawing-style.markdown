This site runs on a custom [Tumblr theme][Tumblr] built using [SASS with Compass][Compass], resulting in a CSS3 stylesheet. The page structure is custom as well, using HTML5. The theme is a minimalist responsive design primarily for showing images. Each post's tags are shown in colours derived from the text of each tag using [jQuery]. The theme has built in support for [Disqus] commenting.
