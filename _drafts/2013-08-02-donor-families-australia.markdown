This site is built on [Wordpress][wordpress.com] and is a complete redesign and restructure. I reorganised the entire site structure to be easier to use. I added custom [Wufoo] forms to enable newsletter distribution and easily allow the public to contact the organisation. I then made a completely new [CSS3 stylesheet][CSS_Validator] for the site, creating a professional yet inviting look while complimenting the organisation's emerging colours and typography. I also set up both [public facing][DFA_Facebook] and members only [Facebook][DFA_Facebook] pages for the organisation.
